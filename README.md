# E-commerce Analytics Platform

## Overview
Build a full-stack application that allows e-commerce merchants to gain insights from their store data. The application will connect to Shopify via GraphQL, process and and present data through an interactive dashboard.

## Time Expectations
- Please document any shortcuts taken due to time constraints
- You have 1 week to complete this challenge

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend (Next.js (React))
- Create a responsive dashboard that will display relevant store data (products with variants, collections and orders)

### Backend (Next.js backend or Node.js or Python)
- Create an API using either Next.js backend or Node.js or Python
- Implement endpoints for:
  - Fetching data from Shopify via GraphQL
  - Processing and storing data in databases
- Include proper error handling and logging

### Data Storage
- You can use either PostgreSQL (with Prisma) or MongoDB

### Infrastructure
- Your final solution should be deployed and accessible via a public URL

## Required Deliverables
1. **Source Code**:
   - Frontend codebase (Next.js/React)
   - Backend codebase (Next.js backend or Node.js or Python)
     - Make sure to include database schema definitions/migrations

2. **Documentation**:
   - Setup instructions
   - Any assumptions made during development

3. **Demo**:
   - Deployed application URL
   - Sample test data (if needed for demonstration)

## Evaluation Criteria
We will assess your submission based on:

- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- **Technical Implementation**: Proper use of specified technologies
- **Database Design**: Appropriate schema design and query optimization
- **UI/UX**: Intuitive and responsive user interface
- **Problem-Solving**: Creative solutions to business requirements
- **Communication**: Clear documentation and explanation of your approach

## Bonus Points (Optional)
- Add unit and integration tests
- Add a view to either create a new product or edit an existing product
- Connect an AI service like OpenAI or Anthropic to manipulate or enhance data

## Getting Started
1. Clone the starter repository
2. Follow the setup instructions in the README
3. Implement the required features
4. Submit your solution by the deadline

Good luck! We're excited to see your approach to this challenge.
